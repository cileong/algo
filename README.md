# Algorithms & Data Structures

This repository contains Java-based basic algorithms & data structures.

This project is for learning purposes only,
so the features are oversimplified to demonstrate only the core concepts of the algorithms & data structures.
It is not meant to be used in production.

Feel free to point out any readability improvements, optimisation techniques or errors if you find any.
